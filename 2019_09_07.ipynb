    "You and your friend are playing a game of “Acchi, Muite, Hoi” (or what some on Twitter have been calling the “lookaway challenge”). In the first round, you point in one of four directions: up, down, left or right. At the exact same time, your friend also looks in one of those four directions. If your friend looks in the same direction you’re pointing, you win! Otherwise, you switch roles as the game continues to the next round — now your friend points in a direction and you try to look away. As long as no one wins, you keep switching off who points and who looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like your chances of winning should be 50 percent, since there are exactly two players. But surely it’s not that simple. If both you and your friend choose your directions randomly in each round, what are your chances of winning?"

    "Suppose you’re playing a match at the U.S. Open, and you’re slightly better than the competition: your chances of winning any given point are exactly 55 percent. (Yes, most players are more likely to win the points they serve, but we’re simplifying things a bit.) What are your chances of winning a three-set match, as played by the women, or a five-set match, as played by the men? And what are your chances of winning the whole tournament (seven consecutive matches)?\n",

In short, the first to 4 points wins a game (as long as they’ve won 2 more points than their opponent), the first to six games wins a set (as long as they’ve won two more games), and the first to two sets (for women) or three sets (for men) wins the match. If at any point a set is tied at six games apiece, that set is decided by a tiebreaker, in which the first to 7 points wins (with the same 2-point margin rule applying here).\n",
